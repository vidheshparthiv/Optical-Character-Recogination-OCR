## About

This repository implements a simple OCR (Optical Character Recognition) utility using Python — you feed it an image, and it outputs text found in the image.

It’s handy for scanning documents, extracting text from screenshots, or building further in a pipeline (e.g. translation, summarization).

---

## Features

- Supports image → text conversion  
- Works with common image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)  
- Lightweight and easy to extend  
- Minimal dependencies

## Requirements

| Package | Version / Notes |
|--------|------------------|
| Python | 3.7+ recommended |
| pytesseract | OCR engine wrapper |
| pillow (PIL) | Image processing |
| opencv-python | Optional — advanced image preprocessing |

You’ll also need **Tesseract OCR** installed on your system.  

- **Ubuntu/Debian**  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
Windows / macOS
Download and install from Tesseract’s official repo.

Installation & Usage
Clone the repo

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vidheshparthiv/Optical-Character-Recogination-OCR.git
cd Optical-Character-Recogination-OCR
Install Python dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script

bash
Copy code
python source.py path/to/your/image.png
The program will output recognized text (either in the terminal or saved to a file depending on implementation).

(Optional) Preprocess the image

Resize

Convert to grayscale

Apply thresholding or denoising

These steps improve OCR accuracy significantly.

Examples
Input Image	OCR Output
data/sample1.png	Hello, world! This is detected text.
data/sample2.jpg	1234 ABCD Test OCR line.

💡 Tip: Add screenshots side-by-side for better visual effect.

Tips & Best Practices 🛠
Image quality matters — higher resolution and less noise give better results.

Preprocessing helps — grayscale, thresholding, denoising, resizing.

Text size — ensure the text isn’t too small.

Language models — install additional Tesseract language packs for multilingual OCR.

Common mistakes — correct 0 vs O, 1 vs l, etc. via post-processing.

Batch processing — adapt script to process multiple images in one run.

Logging & error handling — provide clear messages for missing files or unsupported formats.

Contributing
Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! 🎉

Some ideas:

Improve preprocessing pipelines

Add command-line flags (e.g. choose thresholding)

Add GUI / web interface

Add PDF / multi-page document support
